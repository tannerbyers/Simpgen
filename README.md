# Simpgen

My personal Static Site Generator created to make my own simple custom
webpages for my website.

Stack: NodeJs 

## To Start
``` npm run build ```
This will convert the markdown files in the posts directory into html files in the public directory. 

```npx serve ./public/```
This will serve the homepage locally (with linked posts)

Opinions:
---
* Posts are written in Markdown
* Markdown posts will have properties at the top of the file which will also include the specified templating (blog post style vs. project post style)
* I also want a blog post page will add summaries of my posts once they're created 
 
To Do
--- 
 * Add CSS for website
 * Add Project Section
